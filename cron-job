# How to Set Up a Cron Job to Ping the Server

To ensure that the backend server hosted on Render does not go idle (resulting in a cold start), we’ve set up a cron job that pings the server every 30 minutes. This prevents the server from going inactive, thus ensuring faster response times for users.

### Steps to Set Up the Cron Job

1. **Open the crontab** on your server:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add the following cron job** to the file. This cron job will send an HTTP request to the backend server every 30 minutes to prevent it from going idle:
   ```bash
   */30 * * * * curl https://blog-tui6.onrender.com/ > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
   - The `> /dev/null 2>&1` ensures that no output or error messages are logged.

3. **Save and close the crontab** file.

### Cron Job Explanation:

- `*/30 * * * *` – This means the cron job will run every 30 minutes.
- `curl` – This is used to make an HTTP request to the backend.
- `> /dev/null 2>&1` – This discards any output or error messages.

### Verifying the Cron Job:

To ensure the cron job is working correctly:
1. **List your current cron jobs**:
   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```
2. Verify that the job has been added successfully and is listed.

Now the server will be pinged every 30 minutes, preventing cold starts and improving user experience by ensuring faster load times.

I have did this alredy for you, now the server will be pinged every 30mins, to keep it active.
